# Java Repository
- Start date learning Java: 28 August 2017

This repository will be used for storing my Java projects. I have chosen to do a quick introduction to Java programming in order to grasp the basics of the language and to help better understand what is going on with code taken from Hadoop.

If all goes well I may try to create a GUI and combine with my Python scripts/database from Supermarket-Scraper in order to create an interactive meal planner.

As always, any suggestions for improvements to my scripts are greatly welcome.

Cheers.
